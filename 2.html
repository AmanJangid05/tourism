        Gulmarg has everything going for it: snowdressed mountains, greenery, lakes, pine & fir forests and different types of flowers. It is snug in a valley in the Pir Panjal Range. Its name means, the meadows of flowers, and you will come across a lot of meadows decorated with daisies. Most of all though, Gulmarg is the best skiing destination in Asia, has the highest green golf course in the world as well as the highest cable car project.
