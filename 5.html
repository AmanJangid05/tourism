        For six months, the Gurez Valley is cut off from the rest of the world, and that enhances its appeal as a famous tourist destination in Jammu and Kashmir. The people who live here are one of the oldest tribes in Kashmir called the Dard Shin Tribe and speak a language called Shina.

The picturesque valley is surrounded by snow capped mountains, meadows clothed with lindens, walnut and willow trees and the raging river Kishan Ganga.
